    <h2>Favorite Quote</h2>
    
    <p>My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style.<br> <br>
							-Maya Angelou
	<h2>Theme Song</h2>
	
	<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioV1ZUKsahk">Energy</a>  by Drake because it speaks the truth an tells how people try to stop you from doing what you want to do in your life to try to get to the next level.</p>
	
	 <h2>Favorite Color</h2>
	 
	 <p>My favorite color is Maroon, only because I like the name. About a year ago it used to be black but someone very wise told me that black is not a color but the simple absents of color.</p>
